# Importance in modern enterprises
As enterprises embrace digital transformation and rely on cloud services, mobile access, and remote workforces, the importance of IAM is magnified:

* Data protection: IAM safeguards sensitive data from unauthorised access and breaches, protecting an organisation's reputation and bottom line.
  Compliance: Strict regulatory requirements demand robust IAM strategies to avoid hefty fines and legal consequences.

* User experience: IAM solutions such as SSO enhance user experience by simplifying access without compromising security.

* Adaptability: IAM continuously evolves to counter emerging cyber threats, providing adaptive security measures.



IAM is not just a technical aspect of cybersecurity; it's a strategic imperative for modern enterprises. It enhances security, streamlines access management, and empowers organisations to navigate the digital age confidently. In the following tasks, we'll apply these key concepts to practical scenarios.
